# SocialCircleClusterer
The model aims to classify the facebook circle of a persn into clusters based on features from a user's timeline and facebook data.
Features selected:
1. number of photos tagged together, 
2. number of conversations with a particular topic, say music, 
3. checkins together (helping in determining a party buddy) etc.

This model is a simple k-means clustering based model and visualizes IDs of the users in a k-means clustering plot.
